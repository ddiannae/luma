For each ChIP-seq, 2 plates 70-80% confluent (around total 20 millions MCF7 cells) were lysed in SDS buffer (1% SDS, 10 mM EDTA, 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0)) and sonicated for 20 cycles 30 sec ON 30 sec OFF in Bioruptor sonicator (Diagenode). Subsequently, chromatin was diluted in dilution buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 0.5  mM EGTA pH 8.0, 1% Triton-X-100, 140 mM NaCl) and incubated over night with 10 ug of antibody coupled with magnetic beads. Afterwards, beads were washed 7 times with RIPA buffer (50mM HEPES pH7.6, 1mM EDTA pH8, 0.7% Na-deoxycholate, 1% NP-40, 0.5 M LiCl2) and reverse cross-linked at 65 degrees overnight in Elution buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH8, 1 mM EDTA pH8, 1% SDS). RNA was digested at 37 degrees in RNAse A (Ambion), and proteins were digested with proteinase K (Life Technologies) at 56 degrees. DNA was isolated by Phenol-chloroform extraction followed by Ethanol precipitation.
Library preparation for sequencing was done following the instructions of TruSeq DNA sample preparation kit from Illumina.

    <Data-Processing>
ChIP-seq reads were aligned to the hg19 genome assembly using Bowtie2 with default parameters.
samtools was used to convert the SAM file into BAM and subsequently sort the BAM file.
Duplicate reads were removed with samtools and the resulting file was converted into a BED file containing the aligned unique reads.
MACS2 with default parameters was used to call the peaks over the MCF7 input DNA obtained from unChIPped material.
Genome_build: hg19
Supplementary_files_format_and_content: bed files contain ChIP-seq peaks and were generated by using MACS2.

For each ChIP-seq, 2 plates 70-80% confluent (around total 20 millions MCF7 cells) were lysed in SDS buffer (1% SDS, 10 mM EDTA, 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0)) and sonicated for 20 cycles 30 sec ON 30 sec OFF in Bioruptor sonicator (Diagenode). Subsequently, chromatin was diluted in dilution buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 0.5  mM EGTA pH 8.0, 1% Triton-X-100, 140 mM NaCl) and incubated over night with 10 ug of antibody coupled with magnetic beads. Afterwards, beads were washed 7 times with RIPA buffer (50mM HEPES pH7.6, 1mM EDTA pH8, 0.7% Na-deoxycholate, 1% NP-40, 0.5 M LiCl2) and reverse cross-linked at 65 degrees overnight in Elution buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH8, 1 mM EDTA pH8, 1% SDS). RNA was digested at 37 degrees in RNAse A (Ambion), and proteins were digested with proteinase K (Life Technologies) at 56 degrees. DNA was isolated by Phenol-chloroform extraction followed by Ethanol precipitation.
Library preparation for sequencing was done following the instructions of TruSeq DNA sample preparation kit from Illumina.

ChIP-seq reads were aligned to the hg19 genome assembly using Bowtie2 with default parameters.
samtools was used to convert the SAM file into BAM and subsequently sort the BAM file.
Duplicate reads were removed with samtools and the resulting file was converted into a BED file containing the aligned unique reads.
MACS2 with default parameters was used to call the peaks over the MCF7 input DNA obtained from unChIPped material.

For each ChIP-seq, 2 plates 70-80% confluent (around total 20 millions MCF7 cells) were lysed in SDS buffer (1% SDS, 10 mM EDTA, 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0)) and sonicated for 20 cycles 30 sec ON 30 sec OFF in Bioruptor sonicator (Diagenode). Subsequently, chromatin was diluted in dilution buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 0.5  mM EGTA pH 8.0, 1% Triton-X-100, 140 mM NaCl) and incubated over night with 10 ug of antibody coupled with magnetic beads. Afterwards, beads were washed 7 times with RIPA buffer (50mM HEPES pH7.6, 1mM EDTA pH8, 0.7% Na-deoxycholate, 1% NP-40, 0.5 M LiCl2) and reverse cross-linked at 65 degrees overnight in Elution buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH8, 1 mM EDTA pH8, 1% SDS). RNA was digested at 37 degrees in RNAse A (Ambion), and proteins were digested with proteinase K (Life Technologies) at 56 degrees. DNA was isolated by Phenol-chloroform extraction followed by Ethanol precipitation.
Library preparation for sequencing was done following the instructions of TruSeq DNA sample preparation kit from Illumina.

ChIP-seq reads were aligned to the hg19 genome assembly using Bowtie2 with default parameters.
samtools was used to convert the SAM file into BAM and subsequently sort the BAM file.
Duplicate reads were removed with samtools and the resulting file was converted into a BED file containing the aligned unique reads.
MACS2 with default parameters was used to call the peaks over the MCF7 input DNA obtained from unChIPped material.

Supplementary_files_format_and_content: bed files contain ChIP-seq peaks and were generated by using MACS2.

    <Title>CTCF modulates Estrogen Receptor function through specific chromatin and nuclear matrix interactions [ChIP-seq]</Title>

    <Summary>
In our work we used high-throughput sequencing methods to get insight in the role of CTCF in ER-mediated gene regulation in luminal breast cancer cells. After assessing genome-wide binding of CTCF, ER, FOXA1 and Lamin B in MCF7 cells treated with estrogen for different time points, we could correlate the interaction to the chromatin with estrogen-induced de novo transcription (from GRO-seq data) and loop formation (from ChIA-PET, Fullwood et al., 2009). We observed that CTCF binding correlates with ER-mediated transcription and its depletion can affect ER-ER loop formation and subsequently gene expression.
